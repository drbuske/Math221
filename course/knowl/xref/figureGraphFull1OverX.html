The graph consists of two separate smooth curves and a secant line. One curve appears in the lower-left portion of the graph, for x less than about −1. This curve decreases as x increases, crossing near y = 0 around x = −3 and then falling rapidly, becoming very steep as it approaches x = 0 from the left. A second curve appears in the upper right portion of the graph, for x greater than about 1. This curve begins at high positive y-values just to the right of x = 1 and decreases as x increases. It passes near the points (2, 1) and (3, 0.5), which are shown as filled points and labeled accordingly. A red line segment is drawn connecting the points (2, 1) and (3, 0.5). This secant line slopes downward from left to right and intersects the graph only at these two labeled points. There is a gap between the two curves near x = 0, indicating the function is not defined or not shown there. The figure emphasizes the use of two points on the graph to form a secant line."'></div>
