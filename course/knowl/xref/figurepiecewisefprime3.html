The horizontal axis is labeled x and the vertical axis is labeled y, with integer tick marks shown. The graph of f(x) is drawn with a thick blue curve. On the left and right, the graph rises steeply upward, with arrows indicating that the function continues to increase beyond the edges of the graph. Between x = −2 and x = 2, the graph forms a smooth, curved arch that reaches a local maximum near the point (0, 4). At x = −2 and x = 2, the graph has sharp corners at the points (−2, 1) and (2, 1), indicating that f is not differentiable at those x-values. The graph of f′(x) is shown in red. It consists of several line segments and rays with open circles indicating points where the derivative is not defined. One red segment with negative slope appears between x = −2 and x = 2, crossing the y-axis near y = −1 and ending with open circles near x = −2 and x = 2. Additional red rays appear to the left of x = −2 and to the right of x = 2 with positive slope, each starting at an open circle. The figure emphasizes the relationship between a function and its derivative, showing that f′(x) is undefined at the corner points of f and changes sign according to whether f is increasing or decreasing."'></div>
