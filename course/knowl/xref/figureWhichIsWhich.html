The horizontal axis is labeled x and the vertical axis is labeled y, with integer tick marks shown. One graph is a solid blue curve. It oscillates smoothly across the interval, reaching a high point above y = 6 near x = −4, then decreasing to cross the x-axis near x = −1. The curve continues downward to a deep minimum below y = −5 near x = 4, before increasing again toward the right. A second graph is a black dashed curve. It oscillates with smaller amplitude than the blue curve, crossing the x-axis several times. It has local maxima near x = −4 and x = 4 and a local minimum near x = 1. A third graph is a red dotted curve. This curve also oscillates and appears phase-shifted relative to the black dashed curve. It has a local minimum near x = −4, a local maximum near x = −2, another minimum near x = 1, and a local maximum near x = 3. All three functions are continuous over the displayed interval and intersect or approach one another at several x-values. The figure emphasizes comparison of amplitude, phase shift, and oscillatory behavior among the three functions."'></div>
