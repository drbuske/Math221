Answers       Don’t confuse Katherine’s distance with her velocity.   Katherine's distance vs. time.         Katherine's velocity vs. time.        Katherine’s average speed is mph.       Velocity is distance divided by time. That is, .  For the first leg of her trip, the time taken is hours.  For the second leg of her trip, the distance traveled is miles.  This information is useful in computing the total distance and the total time for the whole trip. The total distance is 30 + 30 or 60 miles. The total time taken is 0.75 + 0.5 = 1.25 hours.  So, her average velocity is mph.    The first leg of Dale’s trip is 20 miles. The second leg of Dale’s trip is 30 miles.  So, the average velocity on his trip is mph.    In order to average 60 mph for the entire trip, the total time taken should be or 2 minutes.  But, the first leg of the trip takes 2 minutes. So it is impossible to average this velocity since it will take a positive amount of time to travel the second mile.       The velocity on is ft\/sec.  The velocity on is ft\/sec.  The grapefruit traveled faster over the time interval .    The average velocity on is ft\/sec. The negative sign tells us the grapefruit is travelling downward.

As you will see soon, the derivative relies upon the ideas of average rate of change and limits. Indeed, the derivative is all about change that is happening instantaneously, and that instantaneous rate is the limit of corresponding average rates. One especially important note at the outset: the definition of the derivative is notationally complicated .

  "title": "Daily Prep 1.5 - Interpreting, Estimating, and Using the Derivative",
  "body": " Daily Prep 1.5 - Interpreting, Estimating, and Using the Derivative   Overview  From early in the course, we have associated the derivative of a function with velocity: indeed, if a given function represents the position of a moving object along an axis, then its derivative measures precisely the instantaneous velocity of the object at a given time. Further, we know that regardless of the function under consideration, the derivative measures not only the slope of the tangent line at a given point, but also the function’s instantaneous rate of change with respect to the input variable. But what is the meaning of this instantaneous rate of change in contexts other than velocity? For instance, what if a function measures the size of a population at a given time? or the total revenue being generated by a sales of a product? or the rate at which a car consumes gasoline at a given speed? In what follows, we take a closer look at the meaning of the derivative in applied contexts.

Note: You might think at first that the statement has something to do with the velocity of the water, but in fact a flow rate of 10 cubic feet per second could be achieved either with very slowly moving water through a large pipe, or with very rapidly moving water through a narrow pipe.

  "body": " Daily Prep 1.7 - Limits, Continuity, and Differentiability   Overview  We are returning to study limits of general functions, and examine how we can evaluate them. In particular, we will see that functions which are “nice” in a certain way (we will call such functions “continuous”) allow us to evaluate limits very easily. Knowing which functions are continuous or where they fail to be continuous will then enable us to focus on the interesting parts of functions, where we actually need to consider a limit.  We are about to wrap up Chapter 1 of the text, titled Understanding the Derivative . One key aspect of understanding the derivative is how a differentiable function is locally linear. That is, how a differentiable function, up close, looks like a line. This enables us to use linear functions – the simplest functions in all of mathematics – as an effective tool to estimate the values of a differentiable function for x-values near a certain point where we know key information. Here, we are basically using some sophisticated ideas from calculus to do something natural: if we can see or identify a trend in how a function is changing at a given point, what might we predict for the future? Following a tangent line is a good approach to doing so.  This section covers the following concepts: Limit Laws and how to use them to evaluate limits algebraically, One-sided limits, Continuity, Direct Substitution Property, Evaluating (one-sided) limits algebraically, Differentiability, Relationship between Differentiability and Continuity, Linearization of a function.

  "title": "Daily Prep 2.1 - Elementary Differentiation Rules",
  "body": " Daily Prep 2.1 - Elementary Differentiation Rules   Overview  Having now completed Chapter 1 on the definition and meaning of the derivative, we turn to Chapter 2 where our principal focus will be on computing derivatives. By this we mean that we want to further understand the limit definition of the derivative and patterns that can be found in certain classes of functions, patterns that will enable us to simply look at the formula for a function and then be able to write down a formula for the derivative . As we progress through Chapter 2, you’ll see that we will build from the simplest functions to much more complicated ones.  This section covers the following concepts: Notations for derivatives. The Power Rule. Differentiation of exponential functions. The derivative of constant multiples, sums, and differences of functions.    Basic learning objectives  These are the tasks you should be able to perform with reasonable fluency when you arrive at our next class meeting. Important new vocabulary words are indicated in italics . Check each box when you feel confident you have a firm grasp on that objective.    Use Leibniz notation for derivatives: as well as .    Use elementary differentiation rules to differentiate polynomials, power functions, and exponential functions.    Use the constant rule and the sum and difference rule to differentiate combinations of the above functions.      To prepare for class  Complete all actions listed below.

Submit screenshots and responses to the questions posed.     Create a variable by typing the letter in the input box on the left.    A slider should be created underneath. You will want to change the minimum and maximum values to 1.1 and 5.0 by clicking on these values at the left and right of the slider. Set your step size to 0.01.    In the next input box, type . You will need to use the key above the 6. The function will automatically be defined, graphed, and labeled for you.    In the next input box, type A = (0,1) . This wil plot and label the point on your graph.    Next, you will want to use the menu. On the fourth button (see below), choose the Tangents option. Then, click on point A on your graph followed by clicking on the graph itself. This will produce a tangent line to your function at . It will name this tangent line and an expression for it will appear in the next input box.     Move the slider for as you wish by moving the big black point back and forth. Note how your function and your tangent line change automatically!    Type ln(a) in the next open input box. Move the slider and compare the slope of to this value. What do you notice? Does this surprise you or not? Explain.
