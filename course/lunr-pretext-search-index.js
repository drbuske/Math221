Answers       Don’t confuse Katherine’s distance with her velocity.   Katherine's distance vs. time.         Katherine's velocity vs. time.        Katherine’s average speed is mph.       Velocity is distance divided by time. That is, .  For the first leg of her trip, the time taken is hours.  For the second leg of her trip, the distance traveled is miles.  This information is useful in computing the total distance and the total time for the whole trip. The total distance is 30 + 30 or 60 miles. The total time taken is 0.75 + 0.5 = 1.25 hours.  So, her average velocity is mph.    The first leg of Dale’s trip is 20 miles. The second leg of Dale’s trip is 30 miles.  So, the average velocity on his trip is mph.    In order to average 60 mph for the entire trip, the total time taken should be or 2 minutes.  But, the first leg of the trip takes 2 minutes. So it is impossible to average this velocity since it will take a positive amount of time to travel the second mile.       The velocity on is ft\/sec.  The velocity on is ft\/sec.  The grapefruit traveled faster over the time interval .    The average velocity on is ft\/sec. The negative sign tells us the grapefruit is travelling downward.

  "body": " Daily Prep 1.3 - The Derivative of a Function at a Point   Overview  Up next in our discussions is the definition of the foundational idea of nearly all first semester calculus: the derivative of a function at a point. As you will see soon, the derivative relies upon the ideas of average rate of change and limits. Indeed, the derivative is all about change that is happening instantaneously, and that instantaneous rate is the limit of corresponding average rates. One especially important note at the outset: the definition of the derivative is notationally complicated . As you read and study, pay close attention to the notation used in the definition of the derivative, and strive to not only know that notation by heart, but to make sense of it for yourself.  This section covers the following concepts: Average and instantaneous rate of change. Definition of the derivative at a point. Differentiability. Units of the derivative. Slope of the tangent line.    Basic learning objectives  These are the tasks you should be able to perform with reasonable fluency when you arrive at our next class meeting.
