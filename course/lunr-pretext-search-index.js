Answers       Don’t confuse Katherine’s distance with her velocity.   Katherine's distance vs. time.         Katherine's velocity vs. time.        Katherine’s average speed is mph.       Velocity is distance divided by time. That is, .  For the first leg of her trip, the time taken is hours.  For the second leg of her trip, the distance traveled is miles.  This information is useful in computing the total distance and the total time for the whole trip. The total distance is 30 + 30 or 60 miles. The total time taken is 0.75 + 0.5 = 1.25 hours.  So, her average velocity is mph.    The first leg of Dale’s trip is 20 miles. The second leg of Dale’s trip is 30 miles.  So, the average velocity on his trip is mph.    In order to average 60 mph for the entire trip, the total time taken should be or 2 minutes.  But, the first leg of the trip takes 2 minutes. So it is impossible to average this velocity since it will take a positive amount of time to travel the second mile.       The velocity on is ft\/sec.  The velocity on is ft\/sec.  The grapefruit traveled faster over the time interval .    The average velocity on is ft\/sec. The negative sign tells us the grapefruit is travelling downward.

  "body": " Daily Prep 1.3 - The Derivative of a Function at a Point   Overview  Up next in our discussions is the definition of the foundational idea of nearly all first semester calculus: the derivative of a function at a point. As you will see soon, the derivative relies upon the ideas of average rate of change and limits. Indeed, the derivative is all about change that is happening instantaneously, and that instantaneous rate is the limit of corresponding average rates. One especially important note at the outset: the definition of the derivative is notationally complicated . As you read and study, pay close attention to the notation used in the definition of the derivative, and strive to not only know that notation by heart, but to make sense of it for yourself.  This section covers the following concepts: Average and instantaneous rate of change. Definition of the derivative at a point. Differentiability. Units of the derivative.

When we can find , we understand that this value represents the instantaneous rate of change of the function with respect to the input variable, and also the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point .  By viewing the constant as a variable in its own right, we will next begin thinking about how is itself a function, indeed a function that is related to - or derived from - the original function .

  "title": "Daily Prep 1.5 - Interpreting, Estimating, and Using the Derivative",
  "body": " Daily Prep 1.5 - Interpreting, Estimating, and Using the Derivative   Overview  From early in the course, we have associated the derivative of a function with velocity: indeed, if a given function represents the position of a moving object along an axis, then its derivative measures precisely the instantaneous velocity of the object at a given time. Further, we know that regardless of the function under consideration, the derivative measures not only the slope of the tangent line at a given point, but also the function’s instantaneous rate of change with respect to the input variable. But what is the meaning of this instantaneous rate of change in contexts other than velocity? For instance, what if a function measures the size of a population at a given time? or the total revenue being generated by a sales of a product? or the rate at which a car consumes gasoline at a given speed? In what follows, we take a closer look at the meaning of the derivative in applied contexts.

Water is flowing through a pipe at a constant rate of 10 cubic feet per second. Interpret this rate as the derivative of some function.   Note: You might think at first that the statement has something to do with the velocity of the water, but in fact a flow rate of 10 cubic feet per second could be achieved either with very slowly moving water through a large pipe, or with very rapidly moving water through a narrow pipe. If we look at the units - cubic feet per second - we realize that we are being given the rate of change of a quantity measured in cubic feet (i.e. a rate of change of a volume).

  "title": "Daily Prep 1.7 - Limits, Continuity, and Differentiability",
  "body": " Daily Prep 1.7 - Limits, Continuity, and Differentiability   Overview  We are returning to study limits of general functions, and examine how we can evaluate them. In particular, we will see that functions which are “nice” in a certain way (we will call such functions “continuous”) allow us to evaluate limits very easily. Knowing which functions are continuous or where they fail to be continuous will then enable us to focus on the interesting parts of functions, where we actually need to consider a limit.  We are about to wrap up Chapter 1 of the text, titled Understanding the Derivative . One key aspect of understanding the derivative is how a differentiable function is locally linear. That is, how a differentiable function, up close, looks like a line. This enables us to use linear functions – the simplest functions in all of mathematics – as an effective tool to estimate the values of a differentiable function for x-values near a certain point where we know key information. Here, we are basically using some sophisticated ideas from calculus to do something natural: if we can see or identify a trend in how a function is changing at a given point, what might we predict for the future? Following a tangent line is a good approach to doing so.  This section covers the following concepts: Limit Laws and how to use them to evaluate limits algebraically, One-sided limits, Continuity, Direct Substitution Property, Evaluating (one-sided) limits algebraically, Differentiability, Relationship between Differentiability and Continuity, Linearization of a function.    Basic learning objectives  These are the tasks you should be able to perform with reasonable fluency when you arrive at our next class meeting.
