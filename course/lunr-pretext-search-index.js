Answers   To prepare for class       Don’t confuse Katherine’s distance with her velocity.   Katherine's distance vs. time.  Graph of distance d, measured in miles, as a function of time t, measured in minutes. The horizontal axis is labeled t in minutes and runs from 0 to 120. The vertical axis is labeled d in miles and shows values from 0 to about 80. The graph is piecewise linear. From t equals 0 to t equals 30, the distance increases slowly from 0 to about 10 miles. From t equals 30 to t equals 60, the distance increases more rapidly, reaching 40 miles at t equals 60. From t equals 60 to t equals 75, the graph is horizontal at d equals 40, indicating that the distance does not change during this time interval. From t equals 75 to t equals 120, the distance increases again at a steady rate, ending near 80 miles at t equals 120. Changes in slope indicate changes in speed, and the horizontal segment indicates a period of no motion.        Katherine's velocity vs. time.  Graph of velocity v, measured in miles per hour, as a function of time t, measured in minutes. The horizontal axis is labeled t in minutes and runs from 0 to 120. The vertical axis is labeled v in miles per hour and shows values from 0 to about 70. The graph is piecewise constant and consists of horizontal line segments. From t equals 0 to t equals 30, the velocity is constant at 20 miles per hour. From t equals 30 to t equals 60, the velocity jumps to 60 miles per hour and remains constant. At t equals 60, the velocity drops abruptly to zero for a short interval. From about t equals 70 to t equals 120, the velocity is constant again at 40 miles per hour. The vertical jumps between segments indicate instantaneous changes in velocity, and there are no sloped segments shown.       Katherine’s average speed is mph.       Velocity is distance divided by time. That is, .  For the first leg of her trip, the time taken is hours.  For the second leg of her trip, the distance traveled is miles.  This information is useful in computing the total distance and the total time for the whole trip. The total distance is 30 + 30 or 60 miles. The total time taken is 0.75 + 0.5 = 1.25 hours.  So, her average velocity is mph.    The first leg of Dale’s trip is 20 miles. The second leg of Dale’s trip is 30 miles.  So, the average velocity on his trip is mph.    In order to average 60 mph for the entire trip, the total time taken should be or 2 minutes.  But, the first leg of the trip takes 2 minutes. So it is impossible to average this velocity since it will take a positive amount of time to travel the second mile.      After class       The velocity on is ft\/sec.  The velocity on is ft\/sec.  The grapefruit traveled faster over the time interval .    The average velocity on is ft\/sec. The negative sign tells us the grapefruit is traveling downward.    The instantaneous velocity at time is approximately 68 ft\/sec.   Average velocities of the grapefruit on various intervals computed.

  "body": " Daily Prep 1.3 - The Derivative of a Function at a Point   Overview  Up next in our discussions is the definition of the foundational idea of nearly all first semester calculus: the derivative of a function at a point. As you will see soon, the derivative relies upon the ideas of average rate of change and limits. Indeed, the derivative is all about change that is happening instantaneously, and that instantaneous rate is the limit of corresponding average rates. One especially important note at the outset: the definition of the derivative is notationally complicated . As you read and study, pay close attention to the notation used in the definition of the derivative, and strive to not only know that notation by heart, but to make sense of it for yourself.  This section covers the following concepts: Average and instantaneous rate of change. Definition of the derivative at a point. Differentiability. Units of the derivative. Slope of the tangent line.    Basic learning objectives  These are the tasks you should be able to perform with reasonable fluency when you arrive at our next class meeting.

Graph of a function on a coordinate grid with the x-axis horizontal and the y-axis vertical, both labeled and marked with integer tick marks from −4 to 4. The graph shows a single smooth curve entirely in the left half-plane. The curve begins near the point (−4, 0) and decreases as x increases. It passes near (−2, −1) and becomes steeper as it approaches the y-axis. As x approaches 0 from the left, the function decreases rapidly and approaches y = −4, appearing to have a vertical tangent or vertical asymptote at x = 0.

Graph of a function on a coordinate grid with the horizontal axis labeled x and the vertical axis labeled y, both marked with integer tick marks. The graph consists of two separate smooth curves and a secant line. One curve appears in the lower-left portion of the graph, for x less than about −1. This curve decreases as x increases, crossing near y = 0 around x = −3 and then falling rapidly, becoming very steep as it approaches x = 0 from the left. A second curve appears in the upper right portion of the graph, for x greater than about 1. This curve begins at high positive y-values just to the right of x = 1 and decreases as x increases. It passes near the points (2, 1) and (3, 0.5), which are shown as filled points and labeled accordingly. A red line segment is drawn connecting the points (2, 1) and (3, 0.5).

Two points on the curve are highlighted and labeled. One point is labeled (−1, one-half), and another is labeled (1, 2). A straight line is drawn through each of these points, representing tangent or linear approximation lines. The line through the point (−1, one-half) has a shallow positive slope and extends across the graph. The line through the point (1, 2) has a steeper positive slope and intersects the curve near that point. At the point (0, 1), the curve passes through the y-axis and is shown to lie between the two straight lines.

It increases from the left, reaching a local maximum near x = −1 at a y-value slightly above 4. It then decreases, crossing the x-axis near x = 2, and continues downward to a local minimum near x = 4 with a y-value below −2.

From (−1, 1), the graph increases linearly to a peak near (1, 5). From that peak, f decreases linearly again to the right, ending near the point (5, 3). The corners at x = −1 and x = 1 indicate points where the slope changes abruptly. Several red open circles appear on the graph of f(x). One open circle is shown at the point (−1, 2), and another at (1, 2), indicating values that are not attained by the function at those x-values. Below the x-axis, the graph of f′(x) is shown using horizontal red line segments. For x less than −1, f′(x) is a constant negative value, shown by a horizontal segment ending with an open circle at x = −1. For x between 1 and 5, f′(x) is a constant positive value, shown by a horizontal segment starting with an open circle at x = 1. There is no value of f′ shown at the corner points x = −1 and x = 1, indicating the derivative does not exist at those points.

  "body": " Daily Prep 1.5 - Interpreting, Estimating, and Using the Derivative   Overview  From early in the course, we have associated the derivative of a function with velocity: indeed, if a given function represents the position of a moving object along an axis, then its derivative measures precisely the instantaneous velocity of the object at a given time. Further, we know that regardless of the function under consideration, the derivative measures not only the slope of the tangent line at a given point, but also the function’s instantaneous rate of change with respect to the input variable. But what is the meaning of this instantaneous rate of change in contexts other than velocity? For instance, what if a function measures the size of a population at a given time? or the total revenue being generated by a sales of a product? or the rate at which a car consumes gasoline at a given speed?

  "title": "Daily Prep 1.7 - Limits, Continuity, and Differentiability",
  "body": " Daily Prep 1.7 - Limits, Continuity, and Differentiability   Overview  We are returning to study limits of general functions, and examine how we can evaluate them. In particular, we will see that functions which are “nice” in a certain way (we will call such functions “continuous”) allow us to evaluate limits very easily. Knowing which functions are continuous or where they fail to be continuous will then enable us to focus on the interesting parts of functions, where we actually need to consider a limit.  We are about to wrap up Chapter 1 of the text, titled Understanding the Derivative . One key aspect of understanding the derivative is how a differentiable function is locally linear. That is, how a differentiable function, up close, looks like a line. This enables us to use linear functions – the simplest functions in all of mathematics – as an effective tool to estimate the values of a differentiable function for x-values near a certain point where we know key information. Here, we are basically using some sophisticated ideas from calculus to do something natural: if we can see or identify a trend in how a function is changing at a given point, what might we predict for the future? Following a tangent line is a good approach to doing so.  This section covers the following concepts: Limit Laws and how to use them to evaluate limits algebraically, One-sided limits, Continuity, Direct Substitution Property, Evaluating (one-sided) limits algebraically, Differentiability, Relationship between Differentiability and Continuity, Linearization of a function.    Basic learning objectives  These are the tasks you should be able to perform with reasonable fluency when you arrive at our next class meeting. Important new vocabulary words are indicated in italics .    Describe left-handed and right-handed limits.    Describe the difference between a limit and a one-sided limit.    Estimate a limit from the left and from the right of a function at a point on a graph (or determine that it does not exist).

  "body": " Daily Prep 1.8 - The Tangent Line Approximation   Overview  We are about to wrap up Chapter 1 of the text, titled “Understanding the Derivative.” One key aspect of understanding the derivative is how a differentiable function is locally linear. That is, how a differentiable function, up close, looks like a line. This enables us to use linear functions – the simplest functions in all of mathematics – as an effective tool to estimate the values of a differentiable function for -values near a certain point where we know key information. Here, we are basically using some sophisticated ideas from calculus to do something natural: if we can see or identify a trend in how a function is changing at a given point, what might we predict for the future? Following a tangent line is a good approach to doing so.    Basic learning objectives  These are the tasks you should be able to perform with reasonable fluency when you arrive at our next class meeting.

With those rules in hand, we have found derivatives for the remaining trigonometric functions, and we are now ready to deal with one more way that functions can be combined: composite functions, also known as chains of functions. The derivative rule which helps us deal with these is called the Chain Rule .

Meanwhile, our balloon is climbing at a rate of 2 miles per hour (mph). How much does our temperature change during our first 15 minutes?    In the previous problem, temperature is a function of height, , and height is a function of time, .

  "body": " Daily Prep 2.6 - Derivatives of Inverse Functions   Overview  Functions are a powerful tool in mathematics: each describes a rule or process that takes any valid input to one and only one output. One of the natural questions that arises regarding any function is “can the rule be undone (or reversed)?” Indeed, this is connected to the concept of a function’s inverse. While not every function has an inverse, for those that do, knowing the inverse can be valuable in a wide range of settings.  Among the most important inverse functions in mathematics are the natural logarithm function, (which is the inverse of the exponential function, ) and the inverse trigonometric functions, such as and .  In this section of the text, we explore how we can use the relationship between a function and its inverse to determine the derivative formula for the inverse function and, along the way, learn a key geometric connection between a function’s derivative and the derivative of its inverse.    Basic learning objectives  These are the tasks you should be able to perform with reasonable fluency when you arrive at our next class meeting. Important new vocabulary words are indicated in italics .    State the definition of an inverse function.    Recognize that writing and say the exact same thing.

  "body": " Daily Prep 3.3 - Using Derivatives to Identify Extreme Values   Overview  The theme of this chapter centers on what we can learn from key information regarding the derivative of a function. In Section 3.3, we focus on how the derivative detects extreme values of functions. That is, we investigate how information from the derivative function can tell us whether the original function has a relative maximum or relative minimum at a given point. While many of the ideas in this section will be natural and intuitive (and ones we’ve discussed briefly to some extent earlier in the course), there is considerable new language and reasoning to learn and understand.

  "body": " Daily Prep 3.6 - Applied Optimization   Overview  The derivative of a function tells us key information. We now investigate the concept of optimization. That is, we are interested in determining where the value of a function is greatest or least, and the input value(s) at which such extremes occur. As we move from Section 3.5 into Section 3.6, we start to emphasize problems that occur in a more applied setting, ones that are based in some sort of physical reality. Here, you will be challenged to read carefully and interpret different possible scenarios, identify variables and determine functions, and to use calculus to justify the reasoning behind your ultimate answers.    Basic learning objectives  These are the tasks you should be able to perform with reasonable fluency when you arrive at our next class meeting. Important new vocabulary words are indicated in italics .    (Review) Determine where to look for extreme values of a function on a closed interval, and what we need to do when the interval is open.    Identify and classify all critical values of a function (within any given domain of interest).    Recognize how we often need to introduce a function in order to optimize some quantity of interest:     Identify the variables in the problem as well as the constraints on the variables.    Identify the “target quantity”, i.e. the quantity to be optimized.    Set up an equation to relate the target quantity to the other variables.    Use a constraint in the problem to reduce the number of other variables in the equation to one, and solve for the target quantity to obtain a function of one variable.

The bus stop is across a grassy park, 2000 feet west and 600 feet north of her current position. Alaina can walk west along the edge of the park on the sidewalk at a speed of 6 ft\/sec. She can also travel through the grass in the park, but only at a rate of 4 ft\/sec.    Three diagrams labeled (a), (b), and (c) show different walking routes in a park to reach a bus stop.

  "body": " Daily Prep 4.1 - Determining Distance from Velocity   Overview  In Differential Calculus, we have regularly asked the question “What does the derivative of a given function tell us about the function itself?” Indeed, in many different settings, we have been given information about a function’s instantaneous rate of change, and used that information to determine characteristics of the function itself. In Chapter 4, we provide the most accurate and sophisticated answers to this big question. In particular, we will introduce the notion of the definite integral, which is an important counterpart to the derivative.  In Section 4.1, we start with a familiar question, but in reverse: where previously we were interested in an object whose position we know and sought to find its velocity, now we start with velocity, and see if we can find changes in position and\/or distance traveled.

  "body": " Daily Prep 4.2 - Riemann Sums   Overview  We have begun to see several reasons why we are interested in the area that lies between a given curve and the -axis. The notion of a Riemann sum provides a formal symbolic way to consider approximations to this area. The notation that corresponds with Riemann sums is complicated: indeed, we will often consider expressions such as , and it is essential that you work to make sense of this notation and what it represents. As we progress from estimating certain areas to finding those areas exactly, we will soon start to use limits along with Riemann sums. There, too, it is essential that you recognize what a Riemann sum represents. At the core of all of this, don’t miss the fundamentally simple idea at the foundation: represents the area of a certain rectangle.    Basic learning objectives  These are the tasks you should be able to perform with reasonable fluency when you arrive at our next class meeting. Important new vocabulary words are indicated in italics .    Use basic notation for a Riemann sum .

To estimate the instantaneous velocity at , consider average velocities on the intervals and .    The instantaneous velocity at is approximately ft\/sec; at , the instantaneous velocity is about ft\/sec, and .    Since and , it appears that the instantaneous velocity of the ball at is approximately ft\/sec. Similar computations show that at , it appears the instantaneous velocity is about ft\/sec. Note that , so the instantaneous velocity at is greater because it is less negative. Asking which number is greater is different from asking which number is more negative.      How is the sign of the instantaneous velocity of the ball related to its behavior at a given point in time? That is, what does positive instantaneous velocity tell you the ball is doing? Negative instantaneous velocity?    Think about whether the ball is rising or falling.    When the ball is rising, its instantaneous velocity is positive, while when the ball is falling, its instantaneous velocity is negative.    When the ball is rising, its instantaneous velocity is positive, while when the ball is falling, its instantaneous velocity is negative.

We note that this average velocity is negative, and in fact is the opposite of the average velocity of 24 ft\/sec on the interval .      Use appropriate computing technology to estimate the instantaneous velocity of the ball at . Likewise, estimate the instantaneous velocity of the ball at . Which value is greater?    To estimate the instantaneous velocity at , consider average velocities on the intervals and .    The instantaneous velocity at is approximately ft\/sec; at , the instantaneous velocity is about ft\/sec, and .    Since and , it appears that the instantaneous velocity of the ball at is approximately ft\/sec. Similar computations show that at , it appears the instantaneous velocity is about ft\/sec. Note that , so the instantaneous velocity at is greater because it is less negative. Asking which number is greater is different from asking which number is more negative.      How is the sign of the instantaneous velocity of the ball related to its behavior at a given point in time? That is, what does positive instantaneous velocity tell you the ball is doing? Negative instantaneous velocity?    Think about whether the ball is rising or falling.    When the ball is rising, its instantaneous velocity is positive, while when the ball is falling, its instantaneous velocity is negative.    When the ball is rising, its instantaneous velocity is positive, while when the ball is falling, its instantaneous velocity is negative.      Without doing any computations, what do you expect to be the instantaneous velocity of the ball at ? Why?    What is the average velocity of the ball on small intervals that contain ?    Zero.    Note that is the vertex of the parabola given by . At this point, the ball is neither rising nor falling. On intervals of the form , where , the average velocity of the ball is positive; on intervals of form , where , the average velocity is positive. Hence we expect the instantaneous velocity of the ball at the moment to be zero.    "

First, write a sentence that explicitly describes what we know about the instantaneous rate of change of the given function at a particular instant, with units. Then, write a second sentence that explains the amount of change we expect in the function value if the input variable changes by one unit at the known instant.  Remember not to try to simplify the units on the derivative value, but rather keep the units in the form units of output per unit of input .

Explain the meaning of the statement by writing two sentences that address the instantaneous rate of change and the predicted change in the function, respectively.  Explicitly, your first sentence might have structure like   means that the instantaneous rate of change of when the car has been driven miles is ,   where the final blank should be completed using the units on the derivative. Your second sentence might have form   When the car has been driven miles, if the car is driven one more mile, we expect that the value of the car will by about .         means that the instantaneous rate of change of the car's value when the car has been driven miles is dollars per mile. In addition, when the car has been driven miles, if the car is driven one more mile, we expect that the value of the car will decrease by about dollars.     means that the instantaneous rate of change of the car's value when the car has been driven miles is dollars per mile. This tells us that when the car has been driven miles, if the car is driven one more mile, we expect that the value of the car will decrease by about dollars.

Explain the meaning of the statement by writing two sentences in the structure described above.        means that the instantaneous rate of change of volume of water in the tank when the water is meters deep is liters per meter. This tells us that when the water is meters deep, if the water rises one more meter, we expect that the volume of water in the tank will increase by about liters.     means that the instantaneous rate of change of volume of water in the tank when the water is meters deep is liters per meter. This tells us that when the water is meters deep, if the water rises one more meter, we expect that the volume of water in the tank will increase by about liters.

Explain the meaning of the statement by writing two sentences in the structure described above.        means that the instantaneous rate of change of the soda's temperature at the instant minutes is degrees Celsius per minute. This tells us that after minutes have elapsed, if one more minute passes, we expect that the soda's temperature will drop by about degrees Celsius.     means that the instantaneous rate of change of the soda's temperature at the instant minutes is degrees Celsius per minute. This tells us that after minutes have elapsed, if one more minute passes, we expect that the soda's temperature will drop by about degrees Celsius.

Suppose that measures the value of a car (in dollars) after the car has been driven miles. Explain the meaning of the statement by writing two sentences that address the instantaneous rate of change and the predicted change in the function, respectively.  Explicitly, your first sentence might have structure like   means that the instantaneous rate of change of when the car has been driven miles is ,   where the final blank should be completed using the units on the derivative. Your second sentence might have form   When the car has been driven miles, if the car is driven one more mile, we expect that the value of the car will by about .         means that the instantaneous rate of change of the car's value when the car has been driven miles is dollars per mile. In addition, when the car has been driven miles, if the car is driven one more mile, we expect that the value of the car will decrease by about dollars.     means that the instantaneous rate of change of the car's value when the car has been driven miles is dollars per mile. This tells us that when the car has been driven miles, if the car is driven one more mile, we expect that the value of the car will decrease by about dollars.      Suppose that measures the amount of water (in liters) in a tank that is filled with water that is meters deep. Explain the meaning of the statement by writing two sentences in the structure described above.        means that the instantaneous rate of change of volume of water in the tank when the water is meters deep is liters per meter. This tells us that when the water is meters deep, if the water rises one more meter, we expect that the volume of water in the tank will increase by about liters.     means that the instantaneous rate of change of volume of water in the tank when the water is meters deep is liters per meter. This tells us that when the water is meters deep, if the water rises one more meter, we expect that the volume of water in the tank will increase by about liters.      Suppose that measures the temperature of a can of soda (in degrees Celsius) in a refrigerator at time in minutes. Explain the meaning of the statement by writing two sentences in the structure described above.        means that the instantaneous rate of change of the soda's temperature at the instant minutes is degrees Celsius per minute. This tells us that after minutes have elapsed, if one more minute passes, we expect that the soda's temperature will drop by about degrees Celsius.     means that the instantaneous rate of change of the soda's temperature at the instant minutes is degrees Celsius per minute. This tells us that after minutes have elapsed, if one more minute passes, we expect that the soda's temperature will drop by about degrees Celsius.      Suppose that measures the rate at which a person burns calories (in calories per hour) when riding a bike at a speed of kilometers per hour. Explain the meaning of the statement by writing two sentences in the structure described above.        means that the instantaneous rate of change of the rate at which the biker is burning calories when traveling at a speed of kilometers per hour is calories per hour per kilometer per hour. This tells us that when the person is riding at kilometers per hour, if they increase their speed by kilometer per hour, we expect that they will burn about additional calories over the next hour.     means that the instantaneous rate of change of the rate at which the biker is burning calories when traveling at a speed of kilometers per hour is calories per hour per kilometer per hour. This tells us that when the person is riding at kilometers per hour, if they increase their speed by kilometer per hour, we expect that they will burn about additional calories over the next hour.

Based on our work in (a), (b), and (c), is not continuous at and because does not have a limit at those points; is not continuous at since is not defined there; and is not continuous at because at that point its limit does not equal its function value.      Which condition is stronger, and hence implies the other: has a limit at or is continuous at ? Explain, and hence complete the following sentence: If at , then at , where you complete the blanks with has a limit and is continuous , using each phrase once.    Note that the definition of being continuous requires the limit to exist.     If is continuous at , then has a limit at .     If is continuous at , then has a limit at , since one of the defining properties of being continuous at is that the function has a limit at that input value. This shows that being continuous is a stronger condition than having a limit.    "
