              The first, <m>G(x)</m>, looks like two quadratic functions joined together at <m>x = 0</m>: one that's concave down on the left, and another that's concave up on the right.  Three important points on the graph of <m>G(x)</m> are <m>G(-1) = 0</m>, <m>G(0) = -\frac12</m>, and <m>G(1) = -1</m>.

          <p>
            Thinking both graphically and algebraically reveals that the antiderivative we seek is <m>H(x) = -\cos(x) + 2</m>.
            Any vertical shift of this function will have the same derivative,
            but will have a different <m>y</m>-intercept.  The antiderivative that satisfies <m>H(0)=1</m> is shown in <xref ref="F-act-5-1-2a-sol"/>.
