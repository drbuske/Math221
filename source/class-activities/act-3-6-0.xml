        <p>
       The top and bottom margins of a poster are 8 cm and the side margins are each 4 cm. 
       The area of printed material on the poster is fixed at 200 square centimeters.  
       Our goal will be to determine the dimensions of a poster that does this with minimum size.

        <statement>
          <p>Determine a formula <m>A(x,y)</m> for the area of the poster.
Then, give a formula describing the constraint regarding printed material that must be 
satisfied when creating this poster. 
          </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
          <p>
           We seek to minimize <m>A(x,y) = (x+8)(y+16) = xy+16x+8y+128</m>.
That could be made very small by, for example, choosing <m>x=0</m> and <m>y=0</m>.
However, the constraint we face is that printed material must be 200 square centimeters.
That is, <m>xy=200</m>.

        <statement>
          <p>Write the function <m>A</m> found in part (b) as a function of the single variable 
            <m>x</m>.
Over what domain should we consider this function?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            Solve <m>xy=200</m> for <m>y</m>.
          </p>
        </hint>

        <solution>
          <p>
            Solving <m>xy=200</m> gives <m>\displaystyle y=\frac{200}{x}</m>.
Substituting this into <m>A(x,y)</m> gives
<me>
  A(x) = x\frac{200}{x}+16x+8\frac{200}{x}+128 = 16x + \frac{1600}{x}+ 328.
</me>
The domain of this function is <m>0 &#x3C; x &#x3C; \infty</m>.
That is, in theory, we can choose <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> to be extremely small (but positive) and 
then the other variable would be quite large.

          <p>Find the dimensions of the poster with the smallest area. </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
          <p>
           First, we find critical numbers.
But <m>A'(x) = 16 - 1600x^{-2}</m> so that <m>A'(x)=0</m> exactly when <m>16x^{2} = 1600</m>.
That is, when <m>x=\pm 10</m>.
Since <m>x=-10</m> is not in the domain, only <m>x=10</m> is a critical number.
To see that this is a global minimum, a first derivative sign chart can be drawn.
