 <introduction>
   <p>
    A company manufactures rope, and the total cost of producing <m>r</m> feet of rope is <m>C(r)</m> dollars.
  </p>
  </introduction>

<task>
  <statement>
      <p>
        What does it mean to say that <m>C(2000)=800</m>?
      </p>
  </statement>
<answer>
  <p>It costs 800 dollars to produce 2000 feet of rope.
  </p>
</answer>
</task>

<task>
  <statement>
      <p>
        What are the units of <m>C'(r)</m>?
      </p>
  </statement>
  <answer>
    <p>
      dollars per foot
    </p>
  </answer>
</task>


<task>
  <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>C(2000)=800</m> and <m>C'(2000)=0.35</m>.
        Estimate <m>C(2100)</m>, and justify your estimate by writing at least one sentence that explains your thinking.
      </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      <m>C(2100)\approx C(2000)+C'(2000)\cdot 100 = 800 + 0.35(100) = 835</m> dollars.  The cost of producing
      2100 feet of rope is approximately the cost of producing 2000 feet.  We add the marginal cost of producing
      rope above 2000 feet.  
    </p>
  </solution>
</task>

<task>
  <statement>
      <p>
        Do you think <m>C'(2000)</m> is less than, equal to, or greater than <m>C'(3000)</m>? Why?
      </p>
    </statement>
<answer>
  <p>
    greater than; the cost to produce the 2001st foot of rope is likely more than the cost to produce the 
    3001st foot of rope due to economies of scale
  </p>
</answer>
  </task>

<task>
  <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose someone claims that <m>C'(5000)=-0.1</m>.
        What would the practical meaning of this derivative value tell you about the approximate cost of the next foot of rope? Is this possible? Why or why not?
      </p>
    </statement>
<hint>
  <p>
    If the approximate cost of producing the 5001st foot of rope is roughly <m>-0.10</m> dollars (i.e. 
    one gets paid 10 cents to produce this foot), then perhaps an external (government?) subsidy is in play?
