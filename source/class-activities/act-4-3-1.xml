            Because <m>y = 3x</m> and the <m>x</m>-axis bound a triangle with base of length 1 and height <m>3</m> on the interval <m>[0,1]</m>,
            it follows that

Graph of the line y = 2 − 2x with marked points at (−1, 4), (1, 0), and (4, −6). The region above 
the x-axis between x = −1 and x = 1 is shaded blue and labeled A₁, while the region below the 
x-axis between x = 1 and x = 4 is shaded red and labeled A₂.

          <p>
            The line creates two triangles,
            one with area <m>A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 \cdot 4 = 4</m> and the other with area <m>A_2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 3 \cdot 6 = 9</m>.
            Since the latter area corresponds to a region below the <m>x</m>-axis,
            we associate a negative sign to it, and hence find that
            <me>
              \int_{-1}^4 (2-2x) \, dx = A_1 - A_2 = 4 - 9 = -5

        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            For <m>\int_{-1}^0 -\sqrt{1-x^2} \, dx</m>,
            we simply observe that this function is the bottom quarter of a circle of radius 1, 
            and thus the bounded region is a quarter disk of radius 1, thus having an area 
            of <m>\frac{\pi}{4}</m>.
            Therefore,
            <me>
              \int_{-1}^0 -\sqrt{1-x^2} \, dx = -\frac{\pi}{4}

<description>
Graph of y = g(x) on Cartesian axes showing a piecewise curve. Starting near x = −3, the 
graph rises to about g(−2) = 1, then curves downward crossing the x-axis near x = −1 and 
reaching a flat minimum at y = −1 around x = 0 to 1. It then rises, crossing the x-axis 
near x = 2, and forms a rounded hump peaking near y = 1 around x = 3 before returning to 
zero by x = 4.

        <hint>
          <p>
            Use known formulas for the area of a triangle,
            square, or circle appropriately.

        </hint>
        <answer>
          <p><m> \int_{-3}^4 g(x) \, dx = \frac{3\pi}{4} - \frac{3}{2}</m>.
          </p>
        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Finally, for <m>\int_{-3}^4 g(x) \, dx</m>,
            where <m>g</m> is the function pictured in the problem,
            we consider the function on seven consecutive subintervals of length 1.
            Observe that on <m>[-3,-2]</m>,
            the bounded area is <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>.
            On <m>[-2,-1]</m>, the area is <m>\frac{1}{4} \pi</m>.
            Similarly,
            on the next five subintervals of length 1, the areas bounded are respectively <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>,
            <m>1</m>, <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>,
            <m>\frac{1}{4} \pi</m>,
            and <m>\frac{1}{4} \pi</m>.
            Thus, the value of the integral is
            <me>
              \int_{-3}^4 g(x) \, dx = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{1}{2} - 1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{3\pi}{4} - \frac{3}{2}
            </me>,
            which is approximately 0.8562.
