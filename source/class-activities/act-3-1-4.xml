      A baseball diamond is <m>90'</m> square.
      A batter hits a ball along the third base line and runs to first base.

      if at that instant the ball is traveling <m>100</m> feet/sec?
      At what rate is the distance between the ball and the runner changing at the same instant,
      if at the same instant the runner is <m>1/8</m> of the way to first base running at <m>30</m> feet/sec?

A tilted square is shown in gray, with one vertex connected to a blue right triangle. 
The blue triangle has a right angle at its bottom vertex, a leg labeled x on the left, 
and a base labeled 90 on the right. A dashed blue segment labeled z runs from the left 
vertex of the triangle to the right vertex where the triangle meets the square.

A tilted square is shown in gray. Along its lower edge, two red points mark adjacent 
vertices. A short blue right-angle segment connects these two points, with the left 
segment labeled x and the right segment labeled r. A dashed blue segment labeled s runs 
between the two red points inside the angle.

        <p>
      By the Pythagorean Theorem, we know that <m>x^2 + 90^2 = z^2</m>;
      differentiating with respect to <m>t</m>, we have
      <me>
        2x\frac{dx}{dt} = 2z\frac{dz}{dt}
      </me>.
    </p>
        <p>
      At the instant the ball is halfway to third base,
      we know <m>x = 45</m> and <m>\left. \frac{dx}{dt} \right|_{x = 45} = 100</m>.
      Moreover, by Pythagoras,
      <m>z^2 = 90^2 + 45^2</m>, so <m>z = 45\sqrt{5}</m>.
      Thus,
      <me>
        2 \cdot 45 \cdot 100 = 2 \cdot 45 \sqrt{5} \cdot \left. \frac{dz}{dt} \right|_{x = 45}
      </me>,
      so
      <me>
        \left. \frac{dz}{dt} \right|_{x = 45} = \frac{100}{\sqrt{5}} \approx 44.7214 \ \text{feet/sec}
      </me>.
    </p>
        <p>
      For the second question,
      we still let <m>x</m> represent the ball's position at time <m>t</m>,
      but now we introduce <m>r</m> as the runner's position at time <m>t</m> and let <m>s</m> be the distance between the runner and the ball.
      In this setting, as seen in the diagram in <xref ref="Act315Soln2b"/>.

        <p><m>x</m>, <m>r</m>,
      and <m>s</m> form the sides of a right triangle, so that
      <me>
        x^2 + r^2 = s^2
      </me>,
      by the Pythagorean Theorem.
      Differentiating each side with respect to <m>t</m>,
      it follows that the three rates of change are related by the equation
      <me>
        2x \frac{dx}{dt} + 2r \frac{dr}{dt} = 2s \frac{ds}{dt}
      </me>.
    </p>
        <p>
      We are given that at the instant <m>x = 45</m>, <m>r = \frac{90}{8}</m>,
      so by Pythagoras, <m>s = \frac{45}{4}\sqrt{17}</m>.
      In addition, at this same instant we know that
      <m>\left. \frac{dx}{dt} \right|_{x = 45} = 100</m> and <m>\left. \frac{dr}{dt} \right|_{x = 45} = 30</m>.
      Applying this information,
      <me>
        2 \cdot 45 \cdot 100 + 2 \cdot \frac{45}{4} \cdot 30 = 2 \cdot \frac{45}{4}\sqrt{17} \cdot \left. \frac{ds}{dt} \right|_{x = 45}
      </me>
      and therefore
      <me>
        \left. \frac{ds}{dt} \right|_{x = 45} = \frac{430}{\sqrt{17}} \approx 104.2903 \ \text{feet/sec}
      </me>.
