         A sailboat is sitting at rest near its dock.
A rope attached to the bow of the boat is drawn in over a pulley that stands on a post on the end 
of the dock that is 5 feet higher than the bow as in <xref ref="DockAndBoatPic"/>.
If the rope is being pulled in at a rate of 2 feet per second, how fast is the boat approaching 
the dock when the length of rope from bow to pulley is 13 feet?

A right triangle is drawn between a dock on the left and a small boat with a pirate flag on the 
right. One leg runs vertically down from the dock, another runs horizontally toward the boat, 
and the hypotenuse connects the dock to the boat.

          <p>
            In the right triangle in the <xref ref="DockAndBoatPic"/>, indicate 
which sides are constant over time and which sides vary. 
Then, label each side of the triangle with a variable or a constant accordingly.

            The boat will always be 5 feet higher than the bow of the boat.  But the other distances 
            in this problem vary.

          <p>
            Label the height of the triangle as 5 (since it is constant).  Label the base of the 
            right triangle as <m>x</m> and the hypotenuse as <m>z</m>.

            <m>-\frac{13}{6}</m> feet per second

        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Since <m>\displaystyle 2x \cdot \frac{dx}{dt} + 0 = 2z \cdot \frac{dz}{dt}</m>, we have that 
            <m>\displaystyle \frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{2z \cdot \frac{dz}{dt}}{2x}</m>.  When <m>z = 13</m>
            feet, <m>x(t)^2 + 5^2 = 13^2</m> so that <m>x=12</m> feet.  Thus, 
            <md><mrow> \frac{dx}{dt}\Big|_{z=13} = \amp \mathstrut \frac{2(13)(-2)}{2(12)}</mrow>
              <mrow> = \amp \mathstrut -\frac{13}{6} ft/sec </mrow>
