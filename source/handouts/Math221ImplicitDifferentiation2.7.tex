\noindent {\Large\bf{Overview}} \\
In several different contexts, we will see that it is useful to consider a function that is described implicitly, rather than explicitly. A prominent simple example is that of a circle: while no single function of the form $y=f(x)$ can represent every point on the circle, there is nonetheless a key relationship between the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of points on the curve. In more complicated settings, we'll see that while there is a relationship between $x$ and $y$, there is no way to explicitly solve for $y$ in terms of $x$. In this setting and others similar to it, we want to be able to still compute $\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}$. The process of implicit differentiation enables us to do so.

These are the tasks you should be able to perform with reasonable
fluency when you arrive at our next class meeting. Important new
vocabulary words are indicated {\it{in italics}}.  Check each box when you feel confident you have a firm grasp on that objective. 

\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt % Reduce space between items
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{\scriptsize$\square$}
\item (Review) Given a basic differentiation rule, gives its chain rule version.  For example, the chain rule version of $\frac{d}{dx}[x^n] = nx^{n-1}$ is:
$$\frac{d}{dx}[y^n] \cdot \frac{dy}{dx} \ \ \ {\rm{or}} \ \ \ \frac{d}{dx}[y^n] = ny^{n-1} \cdot y'$$
\item State an example of a function that is defined explicitly by a relation between $x$ and $y$, and give an example where the relation is implicit.
\item Determine if a given point lies on the graph of the equation in $x$ and $y$, where $y$ is an implicit function of $x$.

\item Implicitly differentiate basic expressions such as $\frac{d}{dx}[x^2f(x)]$, where $f$ does not have a known formula.

\item Recognize the difference between the notations ``$\frac{d}{dx}[ \ \ ]$" and ``$\frac{dy}{dx}$."

\item Use the different notations $\frac{dy}{dx}$ and $\frac{dy}{dx}\big|_{(a,b)}$ appropriately, given a certain context.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{16pt}

\noindent {\Large\bf{Advanced learning objectives}}\\
In addition to mastering the basic objectives, here are the tasks you should be able to perform after class, with practice:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt % Reduce space between items
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{\scriptsize$\square$}
\item Determine $\frac{dy}{dx}$ via implicit differentiation for complicated curves such as $x^3+6xy+y^3=1$ and $\sin(y)+y=x^3+x$.

\item Find the slope and equation of a tangent line to a curve specified by an equation that is not the graph of a function.

\item Given an implicitly defined curve and a point on the curve, find the local linearization at this point to approximate the coordinates of nearby points.

\item Understand how to use $\frac{dy}{dx}$ (which may depend on both $x$ and $y$) to determine all points where the tangent line to a given implicit curve is horizontal or vertical.
