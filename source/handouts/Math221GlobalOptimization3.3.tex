\noindent {\Large\bf{Overview}} \\
Our main focus in this section will be on understanding how calculus ideas can be used to answer the question of ``where is a given function greatest or least?'' We will begin with a more theoretical discussion of optimization, learning about the Extreme Value Theorem, and from there we'll proceed to more applied settings where we see how calculus provides rigorous answers to interesting questions.

\noindent {\Large\bf{Selected Answers}}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{0}

\item The absolute minimum occurs at $x=c$.  The absolute maximum occurs at $x=a$.  The Extreme Value Theorem does not apply to this case since the function is not continuous on the interval $[a,b]$.  So the existence (or not) of absolute extrema is not guaranteed.  However, that doesn't mean, of course, that it cannot happen.  In this case, it does.  

\item First, we evaluate $f$ at the endpoints $x=0$ and $x=2$.  Note that $f(0)=0$ and $f(2) = 4-3(2)^{2/3} \approx -0.762$.  Then, we compute $f'(x)$.  $$f'(x) = 2x-\frac{2}{x^{1/3}} = \frac{2x^{4/3}-2}{x^{1/3}}$$ for $x \neq 0$.  We see that $f'(x)=0$ when $2x^{4/3}-2=0$ which implies that $x=\pm 1$.  The derivative does not exist when $x=0$.  So the critical points of $f$ are at $x=-1,0,1$.  Since $x=0$ is an endpoint of the interval $[0,2]$, we have already evaluated it.  Since $x=-1$ is not in the interval of interest, we need only evaluate $f(1)$.  We find $f(1)=-2$ . We then compare the values found: $f(0)=0, f(1) = -2$, and $f(2)\approx -0.762$.  By the Extreme Value Theorem, we know the global minimum is -2 and occurs at $x=1$.  We also know the absolute maximum is 0 and occurs at $x=0$.  A sketch of the graph on $[0,2]$ appears below.
