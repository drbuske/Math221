      <alert>Read</alert> the motivating questions and the introduction to <url href="

  <li>
    <p>
      [Submit] <alert>Do</alert> the following construction in <url href="https://www.geogebra.org/classic?lang=en"> <em>GeoGebra</em> </url>. Submit screenshots and responses to the questions posed.
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            In the first input box, type <em>sin(x)</em>.
            This will define and graph <m>f(x)=\sin(x)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            To get a visual <em>estimate</em> of the derivative, we will use the definition of derivative which tells us that
            <me>
              f'(x) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}.
            </me>
          </p>

          <p>
            Rather than take a limit, we will use a reasonably small value of <m>h</m>, say <m>h = 0.01</m>.
            Then,
            <me>
              f'(x) \approx \frac{f(x+0.01)-f(x)}{0.01}.
            </me>
          </p>

          <p>
            In the next input box, type <em>(f(x+0.01)-f(x))/0.01</em>.
            This will define and graph
            <me>
              \displaystyle g(x) =\frac{f(x+0.01)-f(x)}{0.01}\approx f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}\sin x.
            </me>
            Have you seen the graph of <m>g(x)</m> before? Identify it and fill the following blank in accordingly:
          </p>

          <p>
            <me>
              \frac{d}{dx}\sin x = \underline{\hspace{30mm}}
            </me>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Repeat</em> this whole process to visualize the derivative (at least an estimate of it) of <m>f(x) = \cos x</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      <alert>Read</alert> <url href="
https://activecalculus.org/single2e/sec-2-2-sin-cos.html#sec-2-2-sin-cos-4">section 2.2.2</url>.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      [Submit] <alert>Do</alert> some exploration with <em>GeoGebra</em> to conjecture the value of the following limits:
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\displaystyle \lim_{h \rightarrow 0}\frac{\cos h - 1}{h}</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\displaystyle \lim_{h \rightarrow 0}\frac{\sin h}{h}</m>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      One suggestion is to plot each of these expressions of <m>h</m> (namely <m>\frac{\cos h - 1}{h}</m> and <m>\frac{\sin h}{h}</m> - the behavior of each graph near <m>h=0</m> should indicate the value of each limit.
      [Important note: <em>GeoGebra</em> will not treat <m>h</m> as a variable.
      So, use <m>x</m> rather than <m>h</m> in order to explore each limit.
      That is, investigate <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow 0}\frac{\cos x - 1}{x}</m> rather than <m>\displaystyle \lim_{h \rightarrow 0}\frac{\cos h - 1}{h}</m>.] Submission of screenshots would be ideal.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>

    <p>
      Prompt <alert>Copilot</alert> “Why is the derivative of <m>\sin(x)</m> only <m>\cos(x)</m> when <m>x</m> is measured in radians and not degrees?”
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      [Submit] First, try to answer this question before prompting the AI.
      Then, prompt <alert>Copilot</alert> “Can you give me an example of a function whose derivative is periodic but it itself is not periodic?” Is the response reasonable?
