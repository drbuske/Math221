<title>Daily Prep 2.7 - Implicit Differentiation</title>

<section>
    <title>Overview</title>

  <p>
    In several different contexts, we will see that it is useful to consider a function that is described implicitly, rather than explicitly.
    A prominent simple example is that of a circle: while no single function of the form <m>y=f(x)</m> can represent every point on the circle, there is nonetheless a key relationship between the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> coordinates of points on the curve.
    In more complicated settings, we’ll see that while there is a relationship between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, there is no way to explicitly solve for <m>y</m> in terms of <m>x</m>.
    In this setting and others similar to it, we want to be able to still compute <m>\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}</m>.
    The process of implicit differentiation enables us to do so.

              (Review) Given a basic differentiation rule, gives its chain rule version.
              For example, the chain rule version of <m>\frac{d}{dx}[x^{n}] = nx^{n-1}</m> is:
            </p>

            <p>
              <me>
                \frac{d}{dx}[y^{n}] \cdot \frac{dy}{dx}\ \ \ {\textrm{or}}\ \ \ \frac{d}{dx}[y^{n}] = ny^{n-1}\cdot y'

A coordinate graph showing two curves. 
One curve is drawn in black and forms a closed, rounded shape extending approximately from y equals minus 1 to y equals 1, with its rightmost point near x equals 1.2. 
A straight blue line slopes downward from left to right, starting near y equals 1.5 at x equals 0 and crossing the black curve near x equals 1 and y equals 0.5. 
The x- and y-axes are shown with dotted grid lines and tick marks at regular intervals.

              Find the slope and equation of a tangent line to a curve specified by an equation that is not the graph of a function.

              Given an implicitly defined curve and a point on the curve, find the local linearization at this point to approximate the coordinates of nearby points.
