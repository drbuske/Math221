<title>Daily Prep 1.7 - Limits, Continuity, and Differentiability</title>

<section>
    <title>Overview</title>

  <p>
    We are returning to study limits of general functions, and examine how we can evaluate them.
    In particular, we will see that functions which are “nice” in a certain way (we will call such functions “continuous”) allow us to evaluate limits very easily.
    Knowing which functions are continuous or where they fail to be continuous will then enable us to focus on the interesting parts of functions, where we actually need to consider a limit.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are about to wrap up Chapter 1 of the text, titled <em>Understanding the Derivative</em>.
    One key aspect of understanding the derivative is how a differentiable function is locally linear.
    That is, how a differentiable function, up close, looks like a line.
    This enables us to use linear functions – the simplest functions in all of mathematics – as an effective tool to estimate the values of a differentiable function for x-values near a certain point where we know key information.
    Here, we are basically using some sophisticated ideas from calculus to do something natural: if we can see or identify a trend in how a function is changing at a given point, what might we predict for the future? Following a tangent line is a good approach to doing so.
  </p>

  <p>
    This section covers the following concepts: Limit Laws and how to use them to evaluate limits algebraically, One-sided limits, Continuity, Direct Substitution Property, Evaluating (one-sided) limits algebraically, Differentiability, Relationship between Differentiability and Continuity, Linearization of a function.

 coordinate graph showing three smooth curves intersecting near the y-axis. 
A red curve opens upward and passes through the point (0, 2), decreasing slightly to the right before rising steeply. 
A blue curve increases from left to right, crossing y = 2 near x = 0 and continuing upward with moderate slope. 
A green curve opens downward, reaches a maximum at the point (0, 2), and decreases on both sides. 
The curves intersect and bound a small shaded region just to the left of x = 0. The x- and y-axes are shown, with the y-axis labeled and tick marks up to y = 3.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Provide examples (both graphically and numerically) of functions where both one-sided limits exist at a point, and yet the limit at that point fails to exist.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Determine, given an algebraic expression for a function <m>f</m>, where it is continuous.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Describe what makes a discontinuity removable - graphically and in your own words.
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>

<description>
A coordinate graph showing the function labeled (f minus g)(x). 
The graph is a horizontal line at y equals 1 extending left and right with arrowheads. 
There is an open circle at the point (0, 1). 
Above it, a filled point is shown at (0, 2). 
The x- and y-axes are labeled, and the grid includes tick marks at integer values.

<description>
A coordinate graph showing a piecewise linear function. 
For x less than 2, a solid line with negative slope decreases toward the point (2, 3). 
At x equals 2, there is a filled point at (2, 3). 
For x greater than 2, a solid line with positive slope increases to the right from that point. 
A dotted line with smaller positive slope approaches the point (2, 3) from the left. 
The x- and y-axes are labeled, with a grid and integer tick marks.
