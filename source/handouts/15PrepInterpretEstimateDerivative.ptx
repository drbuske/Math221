<title>Daily Prep 1.5 - Interpreting, Estimating, and Using the Derivative</title>

<section>
    <title>Overview</title>
  <p>
    From early in the course, we have associated the derivative of a function with velocity: indeed, if a given function represents the position of a moving object along an axis, then its derivative measures precisely the instantaneous velocity of the object at a given time.
    Further, we know that regardless of the function under consideration, the derivative measures not only the slope of the tangent line at a given point, but also the function’s instantaneous rate of change with respect to the input variable.
    But what is the meaning of this instantaneous rate of change in contexts other than velocity? For instance, what if a function measures the size of a population at a given time? or the total revenue being generated by a sales of a product? or the rate at which a car consumes gasoline at a given speed? In what follows, we take a closer look at the meaning of the derivative in applied contexts.

              Water is flowing through a pipe at a constant rate of 10 cubic feet per second.
              Interpret this rate as the derivative of some function.
            </p>

            <p>
              <em>Note:</em> You might think at first that the statement has something to do with the velocity of the water, but in fact a flow rate of 10 cubic feet per second could be achieved either with very slowly moving water through a large pipe, or with very rapidly moving water through a narrow pipe. If we look at the units - cubic feet per second - we realize that we are being given the rate of change of a quantity measured in cubic feet (i.e. a rate of change of a volume).
