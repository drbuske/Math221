<title>Daily Prep 3.1 - Related Rates</title>

<section>
    <title>Overview</title>

  <p>
    We begin our work in Chapter 3 (Using the Derivative) by seeing how the derivative may be employed to relate the rates of two different quantities that are related and each changing as time varies.
    The main idea here is: if two quantities are related to one another, and each is changing as time changes, then the rates at which each quantity is changing must be related.
    Hence, we consider a class of problems known as related rates problems.

      <p>
        Determine how respective rates of change must be related if the values of two (or more) changing quantities are related.

      <p>
        Use basic geometry results such as the Pythagorean Theorem, formulas for the area of familiar figures, and trigonometry to establish relationships among quantities of interest.

            The blue balloon and the red balloon clearly blow up at different rates.
            Suppose time <m>t</m> is given in seconds.
            In one balloon, the radius is given by the equation <m>r_{1}(t)=\frac{1}{5}t</m> cm.
            In the other, the radius is given by the equation <m>r_{2}(t) = \frac{4}{3}\sqrt[3]{t}</m> cm.

            The volumes of each balloon are changing at different rates.

          We know that <m>dV/dt = 10</m> where <m>V</m> represents the volume of water in the tank at time <m>t</m>.
          Since <m>V = \frac{1}{3}\pi r(t)^{2} h(t)</m> where <m>\frac{r(t)}{h(t)}= \frac{4}{10}</m> we have that
          <me>
            V(t) = \frac{1}{3}\pi \left( \frac{2}{5}h(t) \right)^{2} h(t) = \frac{4}{75}\pi h(t)^{3}.
          </me>
          So, <m>\displaystyle \frac{dV}{dt}= \frac{4}{75}\pi \cdot 3 h(t)^{2} \frac{dh}{dt}</m>.
          We solve for <m>\frac{dh}{dt}</m> and evaluate for <m>h=5</m> feet.
          But
          <me>
            \frac{dh}{dt}|_{h=5}= \frac{\frac{dV}{dt}}{\frac{12}{75}\pi (5^{2})}= \frac{10}{4\pi}= \frac{5}{2\pi}\ {\textrm{ft/min}}.
