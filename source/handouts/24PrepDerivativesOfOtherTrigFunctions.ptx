      [Submit] <alert>Explore</alert> the applet <url href="https://www.geogebra.org/m/cNEtsbvC">Sine, Cosine, and Tangent animated from the unit circle</url>. Before starting this section, it is important to remember how the tangent function is related to the sine and cosine functions. Use this applet to answer the following questions. Submit screen captures and answers to the questions posed as needed.

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Check the <m>\sin \theta</m> box.
            As you move the slider for the angle <m>\theta</m>, the point <m>P</m> on the unit circle moves and the graph of <m>\sin \theta</m> is plotted.
            How is the height of the blue point on the graph above <m>\theta</m> related to point <m>P</m>? Hint: Look at the <em>blue</em> dashed line in the unit circle.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Now check the <m>\cos \theta</m> box.
            As you move the slider for the angle <m>\theta</m>, the point <m>P</m> on the unit circle moves and the graph of <m>\cos \theta</m> is plotted.
            How is the height of the red point on the graph above <m>\theta</m> related to point <m>P</m>? Hint: Look at the <em>red</em> dashed line in the unit circle.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Now check the <m>\tan \theta</m> box.
            As you move the slider for the angle <m>\theta</m>, the point <m>P</m> on the unit circle moves and the graph of <m>\tan \theta</m> is plotted.
            How is the height of the purple point on the graph above <m>\theta</m> related to point <m>P</m>? Hint: Look at the <em>red</em> and <em>blue</em> dashed lines in the unit circle.

            What fundamental trigonometric identity involving <m>\sin \theta, \cos \theta</m>, and <m>\tan \theta</m> does this exercise reinforce?

      <alert>Explore</alert> the applet located at <url href="https://www.geogebra.org/m/hFReSaqJ">https://www.geogebra.org/m/hFReSaqJ</url>. This applet gives you a geometric way to think about the value of <m>\tan \beta</m> when <m>0^{\circ}\leq \beta \leq 90^{\circ}</m>. As you change the angle (via the slider), it strongly suggests that the length of <m>\overline{TB}</m> is <m>\tan \beta</m>. Knowing that <m>\tan \beta</m> is the ratio of lengths of <m>\overline{DP}</m> to <m>\overline{OD}</m> where <m>O</m> is the origin, how could we prove that indeed the length of <m>\overline{TB}</m> is equal to <m>\tan \beta</m>?

            Based on the graph, <m>f(x)=\tan (x)</m> is periodic.

    In addition to mastering the basic objectives, here are the tasks you should be able to perform after class, with practice:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Derive the derivatives of <m>y=\tan x, y=\sec x, y=\cot x, and y=\csc x</m> “from scratch” using only basic derivative rules and trigonometric identities.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Differentiate a function for which the derivative involves a combination of these trigonometric functions, and other rules we’ve learned.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Use all rules learned so far in the context of a real-world problem to find the slope of a tangent line, the instantaneous rate of change in a function, or the instantaneous velocity of an object.
