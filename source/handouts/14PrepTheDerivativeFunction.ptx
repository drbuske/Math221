<title>Daily Prep 1.4 - The Derivative Function</title>

<section>
    <title>Overview</title>

  <p>
    We have recently learned that we can describe the instantaneous rate of change of a function <m>f</m> at a value <m>a</m> by computing <m>\displaystyle f'(a)=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}</m>, provided this limit exists.
    When we can find <m>f'(a)</m>, we understand that this value represents the instantaneous rate of change of the function with respect to the input variable, and also the slope of the tangent line to the curve <m>y=f(x)</m> at the point <m>(a,f(a))</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    By viewing the constant <m>a</m> as a variable in its own right, we will next begin thinking about how <m>y=f'(x)</m> is itself a function, indeed a function that is related to - or derived from - the original function <m>f</m>.
    One of the next big questions is: given a function <m>y=f(x)</m>, can we find a graph of or formula for or other information about this new function <m>f'(x)</m>?
  </p>

  <p>
    The section covers the following topics: The derivative as a function.
    The relationship between the graph of <m>f</m> and the graph of <m>f'</m>.
    Computing the derivative function of basic functions using the definition of the derivative.

On the left, near x = −2, the curve is above the x-axis and increasing. It reaches a local maximum near x = −1 at a y-value slightly above 4. The curve then decreases, crossing the x-axis near x = 2, and continues downward to a local minimum near x = 4 with a y-value near −3.

After this minimum, the curve increases again as x approaches 5. The graph has no open circles, endpoints, or breaks, indicating the function is continuous over the displayed interval."

On the left, the graph begins near x = −5 at a y-value around 5 and decreases linearly to the point (−1, 1), forming a downward-sloping segment.

From the point (−1, 1), the graph increases linearly to a peak at the point (1, 5).

From this peak, the graph decreases linearly again to the right, ending near the point (5, 3).

All endpoints appear solid, and there are no breaks or open circles, indicating the function is defined and continuous over the displayed interval."

<description>Graph showing two functions on the same coordinate grid. The horizontal axis is labeled x and the vertical axis is labeled y, with integer tick marks shown. One curve is labeled f(x) and the other is labeled f′(x).

The curve labeled f(x) is a smooth blue curve. It increases from the left, reaching a local maximum near x = −1 at a y-value slightly above 4. It then decreases, crossing the x-axis near x = 2, and continues downward to a local minimum near x = 4 with a y-value below −2. After this minimum, the curve increases again toward the right end of the graph.

The curve labeled f′(x) is a smooth black curve with a U-shaped appearance. It crosses the x-axis near x = −1 and x = 4 and has a local minimum below the x-axis near x = 2.

The graph illustrates the relationship between f and its derivative: where f(x) has a local maximum or minimum, the derivative f′(x) is zero, and where f(x) is increasing or decreasing, f′(x) is positive or negative, respectively. There are no breaks or open circles shown on either curve, indicating both functions are continuous over the displayed interval."

<description>Graph showing a piecewise-defined function f and its derivative f′ on the same coordinate grid. The horizontal axis is labeled x and the vertical axis is labeled y, with integer tick marks shown.

The graph of f(x) is drawn with solid line segments. On the left, f decreases linearly from the upper left and reaches a sharp corner at the point (−1, 1). From (−1, 1), the graph increases linearly to a peak near (1, 5). From that peak, f decreases linearly again to the right, ending near the point (5, 3). The corners at x = −1 and x = 1 indicate points where the slope changes abruptly.

Several red open circles appear on the graph of f(x). One open circle is shown at the point (−1, 2), and another at (1, 2), indicating values that are not attained by the function at those x-values.

Below the x-axis, the graph of f′(x) is shown using horizontal red line segments. For x less than −1, f′(x) is a constant negative value, shown by a horizontal segment ending with an open circle at x = −1. For x between 1 and 5, f′(x) is a constant positive value, shown by a horizontal segment starting with an open circle at x = 1. There is no value of f′ shown at the corner points x = −1 and x = 1, indicating the derivative does not exist at those points.

The figure illustrates the relationship between a piecewise linear function and its derivative, emphasizing constant slopes on intervals and non-differentiability at corners."

<description>Graph showing two functions on the same coordinate grid. The horizontal axis is labeled x and the vertical axis is labeled y, with integer tick marks shown.

One graph is a smooth blue curve shaped like an upward-opening parabola. It has a minimum near the point (0, −4) and is symmetric about the y-axis. The parabola crosses the x-axis near x = −4 and x = 4 and increases on both sides of its minimum.

The second graph is a straight line labeled f′(x). This line has positive slope and passes through the origin. It crosses the x-axis at x = 0 and increases steadily from left to right.

The figure illustrates the relationship between a function and its derivative. Where the parabola is decreasing to the left of x = 0, the derivative is negative, and where the parabola is increasing to the right of x = 0, the derivative is positive. The minimum of the parabola occurs where f′(x) equals zero."

<description>Graph showing a function f and its derivative f′ on the same coordinate grid. The horizontal axis is labeled x and the vertical axis is labeled y, with integer tick marks shown.

The graph of f(x) is drawn with a thick blue curve. On the left and right, the graph rises steeply upward, with arrows indicating that the function continues to increase beyond the edges of the graph. Between x = −2 and x = 2, the graph forms a smooth, curved arch that reaches a local maximum near the point (0, 4). At x = −2 and x = 2, the graph has sharp corners at the points (−2, 1) and (2, 1), indicating that f is not differentiable at those x-values.

The graph of f′(x) is shown in red. It consists of several line segments and rays with open circles indicating points where the derivative is not defined. One red segment with negative slope appears between x = −2 and x = 2, crossing the y-axis near y = −1 and ending with open circles near x = −2 and x = 2. Additional red rays appear to the left of x = −2 and to the right of x = 2 with positive slope, each starting at an open circle.

The figure emphasizes the relationship between a function and its derivative, showing that f′(x) is undefined at the corner points of f and changes sign according to whether f is increasing or decreasing."
