\noindent {\Large\bf{Overview}} \\
The derivative of a function tells us key information.  We now investigate the concept of optimization. That is, we are interested in determining where the value of a function is greatest or least, and the input value(s) at which such extremes occur. As we move from Section 3.3 into Section 3.4, we start to emphasize problems that occur in a more applied setting, ones that are based in some sort of physical reality. Here, you will be challenged to read carefully and interpret different possible scenarios, identify variables and determine functions, and to use calculus to justify the reasoning behind your ultimate answers.

\noindent {\Large\bf{Selected Answers}}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{0}

\item 1250 square feet\\
Our goal is to maximize $A(x,y) = xy$ where $x$ represents the length of two sides of fence and $y$ is the length of the other (the length parallel to the wall being used).  We maximize $A(x,y)$ subject to the condition that $2x+y=100$.  By solving for $y$, we aim to maximize $$A(x)=x(100-2x) = 100x-2x^2$$ on the domain $0 \leq x \leq 50$ (because $0 \leq y=100-2x \leq 100$).  Since $A'(x) = 100-4x$ we find a critical value at $x=25$ that leads to a global maximum of $A$ on its domain.  $A(25) = 1250$.  

\item The positive number is $\sqrt{2}$. The function $Q(x)$ being minimized is $Q(x) = x + \frac{2}{x}$.  It is being minimized on the domain $(0,\infty)$.  Since $Q'(x) = 1-2x^{-2} = 1-\frac{2}{x^2} = 0$ exactly when $x=\pm \sqrt{2}$, we see that $\sqrt{2}$ is the only critical point in the domain.  A first derivative sign chart shows us that this is a local minimum.  

\item We maximize $$A(x) = \frac{1}{2}x(2x) \cdot \left[ \frac{1}{2}(1)(2) - \frac{1}{2}x(2x)\right] = x^2 [1-x^2]$$ on the interval $0 \leq x \leq 1$.  Note that
\begin{eqnarray*}
A'(x) & = & 2x(1-x^2) + x^2(-2x) \\
 & = & x\left[ 2(1-x^2) + x(-2x)\right] \\
 & = & x [2-4x^2]. 
\end{eqnarray*}
It follows that $A'(x)=0$ exactly when $x=0$ or $\displaystyle x=\pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.  A first derivative sign chart appears below.  

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

The area is maximized when $\displaystyle x=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.  

%%\item Choose $h=20\sqrt{6}$. Then $w \approx 34.5$ cm and $h \approx 49$ cm.

\item 
\begin{enumerate}
\item In (a), the distance is $\sqrt{2000^2+600^2} \approx 2088$ feet.  At 4 feet per second, this takes 2088/4 = 522 seconds. \\
In (b), the distance is $2000+600=2600$ feet.  It takes $2000/6 + 600/4 \approx 483$ seconds.  \\
In (c), the distance is $1000 + \sqrt{1000^2 + 600^2} \approx 2166$ feet.  It takes $1000/6 + 1166/4 \approx 458$ seconds.  This is the shortest time.  
\item Using the fact that time is distance divided by rate, we have $$T(x) = \frac{x \ {\rm ft}}{6 \ {\rm{ft/sec}}} + \frac{ \sqrt{(2000-x)^2 + 600^2} \ {\rm{ft}} }{4 \ {\rm{ft/sec}}} = \frac{1}{6}x + \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{4,360,000-4000x+x^2} \ {\rm{seconds}}$$ for $0 \leq x \leq 2000$.  
\item The domain of $T$ is $[0,2000]$.  $$\displaystyle T'(x) = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{2} (4,360,000-4000x+x^2)^{-1/2}(-4000+2x) = 0$$ exactly when $x=2000-240\sqrt{5} \approx 1463.34$ feet.  $T(1463.34) \approx 445$ seconds.  This is a minimum as shown in the figure below.
