<title>Daily Prep 1.3 - The Derivative of a Function at a Point</title>

<section xml:id="Overview13">
    <title>Overview</title>

<p>
  Up next in our discussions is the definition of the foundational idea of nearly all first semester calculus: the <em>derivative</em> of a function at a point.
  As you will see soon, the derivative relies upon the ideas of average rate of change and limits.
  Indeed, the derivative is all about change that is happening instantaneously, and that instantaneous rate is the limit of corresponding average rates.
  One especially important note at the outset: <em>the definition of the derivative is notationally complicated</em>.
  As you read and study, pay close attention to the notation used in the definition of the derivative, and strive to not only know that notation by heart, but to make sense of it for yourself.
</p>

<p>
  This section covers the following concepts: Average and instantaneous rate of change.  Definition of the derivative at a point.  Differentiability.  Units of the derivative.  Slope of the tangent line.

    <description>Graph of a function on a coordinate grid with the x-axis horizontal and the y-axis vertical, both labeled and marked with integer tick marks from −4 to 4. The graph shows a single smooth curve entirely in the left half-plane. The curve begins near the point (−4, 0) and decreases as x increases. It passes near (−2, −1) and becomes steeper as it approaches the y-axis. As x approaches 0 from the left, the function decreases rapidly and approaches y = −4, appearing to have a vertical tangent or vertical asymptote at x = 0. No points of the graph are shown for x greater than or equal to 0."</description>

    <description>Graph of a function on a coordinate grid with the x-axis horizontal and the y-axis vertical, both labeled. The x-axis shows values from −4 to 4, and the y-axis shows values from approximately −2 to 14. The graph is a single smooth curve that increases for all shown x-values. On the left, near x = −4, the curve lies just above the x-axis and increases slowly. As x increases, the curve rises gradually at first, passing near y = 2 when x is about 1. For x greater than about 1, the curve increases more rapidly, becoming steeper as x approaches 4, where the y-value is near 14.

<description>Graph of a function on a coordinate grid with the x-axis horizontal and the y-axis vertical, both labeled and marked with integers. The x-axis ranges from approximately −4 to 4, and the y-axis ranges from approximately −40 to 40. The graph is a single smooth curve that increases for all shown x-values and has an S-shaped appearance.

On the left, for x near −4, the curve is well below the x-axis with y-values near −35 and is increasing. As x increases toward −2, the graph rises steeply, then begins to level off near the x-axis around x = −1. Between x = −1 and x = 1, the curve is relatively flat and crosses the y-axis slightly above y = 0.

For x greater than 1, the curve increases more rapidly, becoming steeper as x approaches 4, where the y-value is near 35. The graph shows no open circles, endpoints, or breaks, indicating the function is continuous over the displayed interval."

On the far left, for x less than about −2, the graph is below the x-axis and increasing steeply. The curve rises and reaches a local maximum slightly above the x-axis near x = −1. It then decreases, crossing near the x-axis close to x = 0, and continues downward to a local minimum below the x-axis near x = 1.

After this minimum, the graph increases again, crossing the x-axis near x = 2. For x greater than 2, the curve continues to rise, becoming steeper and reaching positive y-values near the right end of the graph.

    <description>Graph of a function with the horizontal axis labeled t and the vertical axis labeled d, both with tick marks. The t-axis runs from 0 to about 3, and the d-axis runs from 0 to about 70. The graph is a single smooth increasing curve. Starting at t = 0, the graph begins near d = 0 and rises steeply for small values of t. As t increases toward 1, the curve continues to increase but with a decreasing slope. Between t = 1 and t = 2, the graph is nearly horizontal near d = 60, indicating very slow increase. After t = 2, the graph rises again and ends near d = 70 at t = 3. The curve has no breaks, endpoints, or open circles, indicating a continuous function over the displayed interval."</description>

<description>Graph of a function on a coordinate grid with the horizontal axis labeled x and the vertical axis labeled y, both marked with integer tick marks. The graph consists of two separate smooth curves and a secant line.

One curve appears in the lower-left portion of the graph, for x less than about −1. This curve decreases as x increases, crossing near y = 0 around x = −3 and then falling rapidly, becoming very steep as it approaches x = 0 from the left.

A second curve appears in the upper right portion of the graph, for x greater than about 1. This curve begins at high positive y-values just to the right of x = 1 and decreases as x increases. It passes near the points (2, 1) and (3, 0.5), which are shown as filled points and labeled accordingly.

A red line segment is drawn connecting the points (2, 1) and (3, 0.5). This secant line slopes downward from left to right and intersects the graph only at these two labeled points.

There is a gap between the two curves near x = 0, indicating the function is not defined or not shown there. The figure emphasizes the use of two points on the graph to form a secant line."

<description>Graph of a function on a coordinate grid with the horizontal axis labeled x and the vertical axis labeled y, both marked with integer tick marks. The graph shows a smooth increasing curve that passes near the x-axis on the left and rises steeply for x greater than about 1, reaching large y-values by x = 4.

Two points on the curve are highlighted and labeled. One point is labeled (−1, one-half), and another is labeled (1, 2). A straight line is drawn through each of these points, representing tangent or linear approximation lines.

The line through the point (−1, one-half) has a shallow positive slope and extends across the graph. The line through the point (1, 2) has a steeper positive slope and intersects the curve near that point.

At the point (0, 1), the curve passes through the y-axis and is shown to lie between the two straight lines. The figure illustrates how the slopes of the tangent lines differ at different points on the curve and how the function’s rate of change increases as x increases."

      The equation of the tangent line to <m>y=x^{3}</m> at <m>x=2</m> is <m>y=12x-16</m>.
      A sketch of this tangent line on the curve is shown in <xref ref="figureTangentX3Ans"/> in red.
      To find this line, note that the slope of this line is <m>\displaystyle \lim_{h \rightarrow 0}\frac{(2+h)^{3}-2^{3}}{h}= 12</m>.
      Then, recognize that <m>(2,8)</m> is a point on the line so that <m>y-8 = 12(x-2)</m> represents the line.

<description>Graph of a function on a coordinate grid with the horizontal axis labeled x and the vertical axis labeled y, both marked with integer tick marks from approximately −4 to 4 on the x-axis and −40 to 40 on the y-axis. The graph shows a single smooth increasing curve with an S-shaped appearance.

On the left, for x near −4, the curve is well below the x-axis and increasing. As x increases toward −1, the graph flattens slightly near the x-axis, then continues upward. For x greater than about 1, the curve increases rapidly, becoming steep near the right edge of the graph.

A straight line is drawn that intersects the curve at a marked point labeled (2, 8). This line has positive slope and passes through the point (2, 8), extending downward to the left and upward to the right. The line is steeper than the curve for x less than 2 and less steep than the curve for x greater than 2.

The figure illustrates a tangent or linear approximation to the curve at the point (2, 8), highlighting the local behavior of the function near that point."
