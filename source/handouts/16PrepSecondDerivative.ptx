<title>Daily Prep 1.6 - The Second Derivative</title>

<section>
    <title>Overview</title>

  <p>
    We have spent a lot of time so far focusing on the derivative of a function, which we will in the future also call the “first derivative”: its definition, its meaning, and various interpretations in applied contexts.
    <em>The first derivative, in essence, tells us whether a given function is increasing or decreasing at a certain point.</em> Next, we are interested in learning <alert>how</alert> a function is increasing or decreasing at a given point, and the key tool to doing so is the <em>second derivative of the function</em>: Here, we consider what happens when we consider the derivative of the derivative of a function.

    <p>
      <alert>Do</alert> a computation in which you find <m>f''(x)</m> for <m>f(x) = 5x^{2}</m> two ways. First, you already watched a video on algebraically computing a second derivative using a limit: <url href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIp6g-u-rkc&#x26;t=125s">Limit Definition of the Second Derivative (9:48)</url>. Similar to this video, compute <m>f''(x)</m>. There is, however, a single limit that can be computed to determine <m>f''</m>. For any point <m>a</m>, it turns out that
      <me>
        f''(a) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0}\frac{f(a+2h)-2f(a+h)+f(a)}{h^{2}}.
      </me>
      Use this formula to compute <m>f''(x)</m> when <m>f(x) = 5x^{2}</m> and compare to the answer you found using the method from the video.

    In addition to mastering the basic objectives, here are the tasks you should be able to perform after class, with practice:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Compute the second derivative of a function, using the limit definition.

        Given a function <m>y=f(x)</m> and the units of measure of both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, determine the units of <m>f''(x)</m>.

    </li>

    <li>

alt="Graph showing three functions plotted on the same coordinate grid. The horizontal axis is labeled x and the vertical axis is labeled y, with integer tick marks shown.

One graph is a solid blue curve. It oscillates smoothly across the interval, reaching a high point above y = 6 near x = −4, then decreasing to cross the x-axis near x = −1. The curve continues downward to a deep minimum below y = −5 near x = 4, before increasing again toward the right.

A second graph is a black dashed curve. It oscillates with smaller amplitude than the blue curve, crossing the x-axis several times. It has local maxima near x = −4 and x = 4 and a local minimum near x = 1.

A third graph is a red dotted curve. This curve also oscillates and appears phase-shifted relative to the black dashed curve. It has a local minimum near x = −4, a local maximum near x = −2, another minimum near x = 1, and a local maximum near x = 3.

All three functions are continuous over the displayed interval and intersect or approach one another at several x-values. The figure emphasizes comparison of amplitude, phase shift, and oscillatory behavior among the three functions."

alt="Graph of a function on a coordinate grid with the horizontal axis labeled x and the vertical axis labeled y, both marked with integer tick marks.

The graph is a single smooth curve. On the left, near x = −5, the curve is below the x-axis and increasing. As x increases, the graph continues upward and reaches a local maximum slightly above y = 2 near x = 0. The curve then decreases to a local minimum just below the x-axis near x = 2.

After this minimum, the curve increases again to a second local maximum near x = 4 at a y-value around 2, then decreases sharply toward the right edge of the graph, falling below the x-axis near x = 5.

The graph has no open circles, corners, or breaks, indicating the function is continuous and smooth over the displayed interval."
