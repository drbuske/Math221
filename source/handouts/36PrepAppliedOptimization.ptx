<title>Daily Prep 3.6 - Applied Optimization</title>

<section>
    <title>Overview</title>

  <p>
    The derivative of a function tells us key information.
    We now investigate the concept of optimization.
    That is, we are interested in determining where the value of a function is greatest or least, and the input value(s) at which such extremes occur.
    As we move from Section 3.5 into Section 3.6, we start to emphasize problems that occur in a more applied setting, ones that are based in some sort of physical reality.
    Here, you will be challenged to read carefully and interpret different possible scenarios, identify variables and determine functions, and to use calculus to justify the reasoning behind your ultimate answers.

        These are the tasks you should be able to perform with reasonable

            (Review) Determine where to look for extreme values of a function on a closed interval, and what we need to do when the interval is open.

            Recognize how we often need to introduce a function in order to optimize some quantity of interest:

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Identify the variables in the problem as well as the constraints on the variables.

              <li>
                <p>
                  Identify the “target quantity”, i.e.
                  the quantity to be optimized.

              <li>
                <p>
                  Set up an equation to relate the target quantity to the other variables.

              <li>
                <p>
                  Use a constraint in the problem to reduce the number of other variables in the equation to one, and solve for the target quantity to obtain a function of one variable.

A coordinate diagram showing a triangular region in the x–y plane. The region has vertices at (0, 0), (1, 0), and (1, 2), with solid line segments connecting these points. The horizontal axis is marked at x = 0 and x = 1, and the vertical axis is marked at y = 2. A dotted vertical line is drawn at an x-value between 0 and 1, intersecting the triangle and labeled x.

              Alaina wants to get to the bus stop as quickly as possible.
              The bus stop is across a grassy park, 2000 feet west and 600 feet north of her current position.
              Alaina can walk west along the edge of the park on the sidewalk at a speed of 6 ft/sec.
              She can also travel through the grass in the park, but only at a rate of 4 ft/sec.

<description>
Three diagrams labeled (a), (b), and (c) show different walking routes in a park to reach a bus stop. In each diagram, the park is rectangular, with a vertical side labeled 600 feet and the distance to the bus stop along the top labeled 2000 feet. In (a) and (c), a diagonal path crosses the park from a corner toward the bus stop, while in (b) the path follows the edges of the park only. In (c), the bottom edge is marked as two segments of 1000 feet each. The diagrams compare possible paths and distances to the bus stop.

            1250 square feet

          <p>
            Our goal is to maximize <m>A(x,y) = xy</m> where <m>x</m> represents the length of two sides of fence and <m>y</m> is the length of the other (the length parallel to the wall being used).
            We maximize <m>A(x,y)</m> subject to the condition that <m>2x+y=100</m>.
            By solving for <m>y</m>, we aim to maximize
            <me>
              A(x)=x(100-2x) = 100x-2x^{2}
            </me>
            on the domain <m>0 \leq x \leq 50</m> (because <m>0 \leq y=100-2x \leq 100</m>).
            Since <m>A'(x) = 100-4x</m> we find a critical value at <m>x=25</m> that leads to a global maximum of <m>A</m> on its domain.
            <m>A(25) = 1250</m>.

            The positive number is <m>\sqrt{2}</m>.
            The function <m>Q(x)</m> being minimized is <m>Q(x) = x + \frac{2}{x}</m>.
            It is being minimized on the domain <m>(0,\infty)</m>.
            Since <m>Q'(x) = 1-2x^{-2}= 1-\frac{2}{x^{2}}= 0</m> exactly when <m>x=\pm \sqrt{2}</m>, we see that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is the only critical point in the domain.
            A first derivative sign chart shows us that this is a local minimum.

            </me>
            on the interval <m>0 \leq x \leq 1</m>.
            Note that

          <mrow>  = \mathstrut \amp x [2-4x^2].</mrow></md>
            It follows that <m>A'(x)=0</m> exactly when <m>x=0</m> or <m>\displaystyle x=\pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}</m>.

                  In (a), the distance is <m>\sqrt{2000^{2}+600^{2}}\approx 2088</m> feet.
                  At 4 feet per second, this takes 2088/4 = 522 seconds.

                  In (b), the distance is <m>2000+600=2600</m> feet.
                  It takes <m>2000/6 + 600/4 \approx 483</m> seconds.

                  It takes <m>1000/6 + 1166/4 \approx 458</m> seconds.

<description>
A graph of a smooth function over x-values from 0 to about 2000. The curve decreases gradually from left to right, then reaches a minimum near the labeled point (1463.34, 445.14). After this point, the graph turns upward slightly, indicating a minimum at that location.
